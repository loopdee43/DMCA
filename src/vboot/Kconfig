config CUSTOM_MUSIC
	bool "Allow the board file to override the default firmware sound tones"
	default n
	help
	  By default depthcharge waits for 30 seconds and beeps twice
	  during the developer mode screen. If CUSTOM_MUSIC is defined, the
	  note array can be overridden and custom tones and delays could be
	  played. A useful example of this is for lengthening the developer
	  mode screen. VbExGetMusicPtr() and VbExMaxMusicSize() must be
	  implemented (in order to provide the particular music data) in the
	  board file when CUSTOM_MUSIC is enabled.

config DETACHABLE_UI
	bool "Enable detachable FW menu UI"
	default n
	help
	  Enable detachable FW menu options, which is used with devices that
	  don't have a keyboard.  This assumes that user will flip through
	  menu options with vol up/down and power buttons.

config EC_SOFTWARE_SYNC
	bool "Enable EC software sync"
	default n
	help
	  EC software sync is a mechanism where the AP helps the EC verify its
	  firmware similar to how vboot verifies the main system firmware. This
	  option selects whether depthcharge should support EC software sync.

config VIRTUAL_DEV_SWITCH
	bool "Virtual developer switch support"
	default n
	help
	  Whether this platform has a virtual developer switch.

config PHYSICAL_REC_SWITCH
	bool "Physical recovery switch is present"
	default n
	help
	  Informs vboot that a physical recovery switch is present

config OPROM_MATTERS
	bool "Video option ROM matters"
	default n
	help
	  Whether the video option ROM has run matters on this platform.

config MOCK_TPM
	bool "Mock the TPM in vboot (TURN OFF BEFORE RELEASE)"
	default n
	help
	  Make vboot pretend that all TPM accesses and checks are successful
	  without actually talking to the TPM. This option can be used during
	  development, or when the current TPM is known to be broken somehow.
	  THIS SHOULD NOT BE LEFT ON FOR PRODUCTION DEVICES.

choice
	prompt "Type of nonvolatile storage"
	help
	  Where depthcharge should keep vboot's nonvolatile storage.

config NV_STORAGE_CMOS
	bool "CMOS"
	depends on ARCH_X86
	help
	  The nonvolatile data is stored in CMOS.

config NV_STORAGE_DISK
	bool "Fixed disk"
	help
	  The nonvolatile storage is stored on a fixed disk. The first fixed
	  disk will be used. To avoid unexpected behavior, there should only
	  be one fixed disk in the system.

config NV_STORAGE_CROS_EC
	bool "ChromeOS EC"
	help
	  The nonvolatile data is stored by the ChromeOS EC.

config NV_STORAGE_FLASH
	bool "Flash"
	help
	  The nonvolatile data is stored in the same flash device with the
	  firmware, location determined by the fmap 'rw-nvram' entry.

config NV_STORAGE_FAKE
	bool "Fake"
	help
	  Nonvolatile storage is simulated using RAM and is re-initialized
	  each boot.
