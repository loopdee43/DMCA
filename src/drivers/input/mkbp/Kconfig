config DRIVER_INPUT_MKBP_OLD_COMMAND
       bool "Old method of retrieving keyscans via the ChromeOS EC MKBP."
       default n
       help
         In older ChromeOS EC images, the MKBP FIFO only contains key matrix
         changes.  Therefore, retrieving the MKBP state will always be a key
         matrix and the EC_CMD_MKBP_STATE host command is supported.  This is
         not the case for newer EC images.

config DRIVER_INPUT_MKBP_NO_INTERRUPT
       bool
       default y if ARCH_X86
       default n
       help
         On some Chromebooks (i.e. x86) that use MKBP driver for buttons,
         there might not be an interrupt coming from the EC to the
         AP. This allows MKBP driver to handle pending EC events in a
         different way.
